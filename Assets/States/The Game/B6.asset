  storyText: 'Next steps

    You again return to consciousness, again wishing you
    didn''t. You take the locked case carefully since it is still very hot asking
    yourself whether it was worth the risk. You do your best to open the case and
    hopefully you succeed.  Among useless in the wild documents you find the cellphone
    however there is no signal. Trying to take control of yourself you see the relatively
    high hill in the distance. However, in the other direction you hear the river
    and a very quiet howl of wolves probably. Where do you decide to go?



    1)
    I''ll go towards the hill

    2) I''ll follow the noise of the river'
