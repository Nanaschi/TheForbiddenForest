  storyText: 'Unreasonable Risk

    Despite anything you decide to scavenge what
    is left. There are bodies or burnt parts of them... Fire spreads around... You
    see in two relatively different directions an axe and a locked case. The plane
    engine nearby is booming and is about to explode.


    1) I''ll go for an axe

    2)
    I''d better pick the case

    3) I''ll do my best to pick the case and the axe
    simultaneously '
