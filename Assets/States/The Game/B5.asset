  storyText: 'Next steps

    You again return to consciousness, again wishing you
    didn''t. You take the axe carefully since it is still very hot asking yourself
    whether it was worth the risk. Trying to take control of yourself you see the
    relatively high hill in the distance. However, in the other direction you hear
    the river and a very quiet howl of wolves probably. Where do you decide to go?



    1)
    I''ll go towards the hill

    2) I''ll follow the noise of the river'
